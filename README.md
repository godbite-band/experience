# GODBITE — alternative rock / progressive metal from Szczecin, Poland

A native-scroll journey through six Three.js scenes: the threshold, ritual, cinema, live club, dressing room and signal. Vite, TypeScript, semantic HTML, local fonts and original Godbite artwork. English and Polish, pulsing synthesized ambient, enabled by default, and still-image fallback.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.12+ and npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the /experience/ address printed by Vite. Production: `npm run build`, then `npm run preview`.

## Update music and films

Edit `src/content.ts`: typed recordings, YouTube IDs, social links and both translations. The EP displayed as **You can lead a horse EP** links to its existing Bandcamp **demo** page. Replace images in `public/images`; the asset preparation script documents their original sources.

- `npm run assets` refreshes official covers and film thumbnails.
- `node scripts/capture-stills.mjs` against the running dev server exports the six real scene stills, social card and desktop/mobile previews.
- Append `--band-only` after the dev URL to capture only the dressing room, including its portrait fallback, without replacing existing artwork or other scene captures.
- Append `--live-only` after the dev URL to refresh only the club, including its portrait fallback. The captured silhouette and its invisible button share the same position on both layouts.
- Set `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE` if using an installed browser instead of Playwright Chromium.
- Cover credits: Mir — Artur Ciechorski; JISM and Social Media Girls — Trash Boat. The original artwork is not licensed for reuse outside Godbite's site.

## Checks

```sh
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:fog
```

Tests cover all recordings and films, lazy media loading, keyboard dialogs, language persistence, motion preferences, context loss, WebGL denial, default audio, retained mute preference, film audio suppression and mobile layout. External YouTube playback is mocked in UI tests; use the published site to verify the real player. Mobile tests emulate a device; confirm frame rate on a physical phone before advertising a performance guarantee.

## GitHub Pages

The repository is `godbite-band/experience`, default branch `master`; Vite's base is `/experience/`.
Select **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**. Pushes to master check types and build the site, then publish to **https://godbite-band.github.io/experience/**. For a manual deployment, select **Actions → Publish Godbite → Run workflow → master**. Deployment is skipped cleanly until Pages is enabled. No separate build branch is needed.

The canonical URL, social metadata, sitemap and robots file use that address. Update them and Vite's base together if moving to a custom domain. No secrets, backend, analytics, or third-party scripts are used at startup. YouTube is contacted only after a visitor starts a film. Ambient sound is enabled by default and starts automatically when allowed, or with the first click, tap or keyboard interaction when the browser blocks autoplay. A deliberate mute is remembered for the tab session. Film playback temporarily silences the ambient and closing the film restores it.

## Atmosphere

The opening taglines share IBM Plex Mono and one measured space. Each holds for six seconds and dissolves with blur and a slight expansion over two seconds, for a sixteen-second cycle. Reduced-motion and WebGL fallback views show both lines without animation.

The dressing room follows Live and precedes Contact. Five empty chairs stand before a tarnished mirror containing five anonymous, stationary silhouettes; procedural condensation drifts across the glass. Cold practical lighting and red light beneath a closed door illuminate the abandoned room. `src/dressing-room.ts` builds the scene without external images or a reflection render pass. `src/band.ts` holds the current and historical lineup and renders an accessible year-based timeline, with an unknown start for Iwo. Recordings use the existing release catalogue. Biography and the relocated manifesto are bilingual; history opens inside a scrollable panel, leaving the camera position unchanged. Desktop and portrait captures supply the motion and WebGL fallbacks. Haze clears before Contact, now chapter six.

Camera positions, room alignment and text fades live in `src/journey.ts`. The forest door and first recording share the centre of the frame. A level arc clears the final pedestal and joins a straight axis through the cinema doorway and screen into the live club; move the rooms and their focal points together when changing a doorway. Camera interpolation preserves velocity and acceleration at every join, with critically damped scroll tracking. `RECORD_STOPS` controls the five recording views; `chapterPresentation` controls text independently of camera motion. `scenePresence` fades each room and its lights continuously instead of toggling them during the recording visits.

The world renders through a custom cinematic diffusion pipeline: soft focus, low-resolution halation, drifting haze, dark color grading and a vignette. Mist is a continuous world-space volume in `src/cinematic.ts`, integrated along each camera ray up to the scene depth at half resolution. Smooth 3D noise replaces the rectangular mist meshes, so there are no card edges or layer crossings; density changes gradually along the journey. Independently drifting denser pockets gather in parts of the volume, with a lighter treatment around album artwork. Both doors have restrained red light behind the opening and thin, softly feathered streaks beside the jambs. These are integrated analytically into the mist, following the doorway transforms and scene fades without adding fog cards or washing the scene in red. Diffusion and image distortion fall to 12% in the gallery, with lighter halation and grain to keep album artwork legible while forest mist remains until the cinema approach; the cinema retains a softer reduction. Direct lighting is sparse and moving. Instanced grass, irregular dark shrubs, twigs, rocks and a textured forest floor continue through the recording gallery, framed by trees around the clear central path. Velvet curtains catch red side light, while a soft rear wash reveals the cinema seats. The next space is an empty club with scuffed walls, stage equipment, litter, warm and cool spotlights, dense drifting haze and softly rising dust motes. Its screen plays the supplied live show in an aligned YouTube iframe after an explicit click; leaving the chapter removes the player and restores ambient sound. All fog and atmospheric haze fade out before the final “Let it in” chapter. The cinema entrance light flare is softened. Signal threads deform independently with slow traveling waves in three dimensions. HTML remains sharp and readable. Reduced-motion and unsupported-WebGL visitors receive captured frames from the same darker scenery.

Ambient synthesis uses two slow pressure waves, an irregular double pulse, detuned low drones, moving filtered air and a long stereo reverb. It has no audio downloads. Its AudioContext respects browser autoplay restrictions; a waiting hint explains the first-interaction requirement.

On touch screens, one-finger downward swipes at the opening retreat into the Easter Egg; upward swipes undo the retreat. The touch distance is scaled to the viewport, so a few swipes reach the trigger. Root overscroll is disabled to prevent Android Chrome's pull-to-refresh. Only eligible vertical gestures are intercepted: links, buttons, dialogs, multi-touch gestures, reduced-motion views and ordinary forward page scrolling retain their native behavior. Touch scrolling is held during the sample, effect tail and return, then resumes normally. `tests/retreat-touch.spec.ts` verifies native Chromium touch gestures through CDP in the mobile browser profile.

At the opening, scrolling the wheel backwards retreats up to 90 world units into the mist. After about 1,920 pixels of backwards wheel input, the camera's arrival triggers the local Skyrim “Never Should Have Come Here” sample once per excursion. Actual audio playback freezes the camera's retreat position and starts rapid spins, tilts and blood-red and cold gray flares. After the sample ends, the effects decay for 1.2 seconds at that position. A separate 2.2-second movement then smoothly brings the camera and its orientation back to the opening; ordinary scrolling resumes on arrival. Wheel input is held through playback, the effect tail and return. Forward wheel input before playback returns to the start; navigation resets the retreat. The sample respects mute, browser activation, dialogs with film audio, and tab visibility. Reduced-motion and WebGL fallback views keep their usual scrolling. The sample loads only after a backwards wheel gesture; its source is recorded in `public/audio/asset-sources.json`. All pointer, mouse, wheel, scroll, touch and keyboard interactions attempt to resume audio, including retries while a previous request is pending. Browser autoplay policies may still require an activating gesture. While audio waits, a drifting saturated-red invitation below the forest opening text asks visitors to click once. It sits outside the heading's layout, so hiding it never shifts the logo or poem. During retreat with muted or blocked audio it grows dramatically; clicking it enables audio and triggers the sample without additional scrolling. It disappears when audio starts and remains still with reduced motion.

The club drum kit includes curved cymbals, a paired hi-hat with pedal, snare, bass-mounted tom and floor tom. The kit fades out over 0.8 seconds during live-screen playback and returns when the player closes, while world animation continues. There is no manual motion toggle; opening Credits or other dialogs leaves the scene moving. The operating system’s reduced-motion preference still uses scene stills. Static views use matching captures with and without drums; reduced-motion views switch immediately. A faint figure faces the wall on the right, with a dim cool outline; clicking it opens the secret Godrite concert and stops any live-screen playback. Its button also supports keyboard focus and Enter, including the still-image fallback.
